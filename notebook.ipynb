For example, let's assume you pledge 1 ETH worth `$1,500` and you can borrow `$700` against it for 30 days. Now to make the swap fair you should receive a call option which is worth `$800` because this way your position value pre- and post borrow is the same, i.e., nobody is better or worse off than before. Now the question is:\n\n> How should we choose the strike price of the call option such its fair value is `$800`?\n\n## Option Pricing\nThe most simple way to price a call option is to use Black-Scholes. While for our case the Black-Scholes model is a crude over-simplification it nonetheless is a good way to start thinking about how to determine a fair APR.\n\nSo, for a European call option we can apply the following Black-Scholes formula:\n\n$C(S,t) = S \\Phi(d_1) - K e^{-r(T-t)} \\Phi(d_2)$\n\nwhere\n\n$d1 = \\frac{ln(S/K) + (r+\\sigma^2/2)(T-t)}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}}$\n\n$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}$\n\nand\n\n* $S$: current price of the collateral\n* $r$: risk free rate\n* $\\sigma$: price volatility of the collateral \n* $T-t$: tenor of the option\n* $K$: strike price\n\nLet's put that into code:",

But what if we wanted to find such a strike price for any kind of loan amount?\n\nBasically, given the current spot price $S$ and loan amount $L$ we're interested in finding $K^*$ such that the following equation holds:\n\n$S = L + C(K^*)$\n\nWe can translate this into the following minimization problem:\n\n$K^* = \\arg \\min_{K} \\Big(S - L - C(K)\\Big)^2$\n\nand use `scipy` for this:",
